# Welcome

I’m a senior at the University of Connecticut studying **Statistics**, with a 
strong focus on **data science, predictive modeling**, and **sports analytics**.

This portfolio highlights academic projects where I’ve applied Python, R, SQL, 
and machine learning to solve real-world problems — from predicting MLB player 
performance to analyzing NYC crash data.

## Featured Projects

[Clutch Gene: Quantifying Performance Under Pressure in Baseball](projects/clutch-gene.qmd)

An analysis of MLB postseason vs. regular season performance using statistical 
testing, clustering, and logistic regression.

[NYC 311 Flooding - Complaint Trends Dashboard](projects/nyc-311.qmd)
`
Mapped and modeled flooding complaints in NYC to identify high-risk areas and 
recurring seasonal patterns.

[Boston 311 Municipal Responsiveness](projects/boston_311.qmd)

Predictive modeling efforts to forecast expected municipal service response times using publicly available Boston 311 data.
