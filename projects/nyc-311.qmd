## Objective

This project analyzes 311 complaints in New York City related to **flooding**, 
with the goal of identifying spatial and temporal patterns. It highlights 
which neighborhoods and time periods experience the most flooding issues, 
helping inform city resource planning and infrastructure development.

## Data Sources

+ Filtered to complaints regarding "Street Flooding" or "Basin Flooding"

# Tools & Techniques

+ **Python**: Pandas, geopandas, matplotlib, plotnine, folium
+ **Geospatial**: ZIP code mapping, complaint heatmaps
+ **Time Series Analysis**: Hourly, monthly, and seasonal complaint trends
+ **Visualization**: Static and interactive maps

## Key Insights

+ Flooding complaints are **seasonally concentrated** in summer and fall.
+ Complaints are most common in **coastal and low-lying areas**, especially parts of Brooklyn and Queens.
+ Several ZIP codes appear consistently in top complaint volumes, suggesting persistent infrastructure challenges.
