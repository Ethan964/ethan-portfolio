# Clutch Gene - MLB Postseason Performance Analysis

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Ethan964/clutch-gene)

## Objective

This project investigates whether Major League Baseball players perform
differently under high-pressure situations compared to low-pressure situations.
It explores the idea of a "clutch gene" – the potential for players to rise 
or fall in high-leverage situations.

By analyzing detailed performance metrics and applying statistical techniques, 
this study seeks to objectively evaluate "clutchness" and classifyplayer 
archetypes that emerge under pressure

## Data Sources

+ Baseball Reference - Regular Seasons & Postseason stats (2021 & 2023)
+ Metrics Analyzed :
    - On-Base Plus Slugging (OPS)
    - Total Bases (TB)
    - Championship Winning Probability Added (cWPA)

## Tools & Techniques

+ **Python**: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, statsmodels  
+ **Statistical Testing**: Paired sample t-tests  
+ **Machine Learning**: K-Means Clustering  
+ **Modeling**: Logistic Regression to predict postseason performance shifts  
+ **Visualization**: PCA plots, delta histograms, performance cluster maps

## Key Insights


+ Statistically significant performance differences were found between regular and postseason play.
+ Players exhibited distinct archetypes, including “Postseason Risers” and “October Collapsers.”
+ Logistic models showed modest but directional predictive power for high-pressure success indicators.
