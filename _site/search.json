    "section": "",
    "text": "The concept of “clutchness” in professional baseball has long been debated, yet remains difficult to quantify. This study aims to investigate whether high-pressure situations influence player performance and whether distinct “clutch” archetypes exist. Using regular season and postseason data from Baseball Reference, we analyze three key performance metrics: On-Base Plus Slugging (OPS), Total Bases (TB), and Championship Win Probability Added (cWPA)—to assess how players respond under varying levels of pressure. We employ hypothesis testing to determine statistical significance in performance differences, K-means clustering for classifying players into specific archetypes, and logistic regression models to forecast probability of success in high-leverage situations. By integrating statistical analysis with sabermetrics, this study seeks to provide a data-driven perspective on the existence of a “clutch gene” in baseball. Our findings could have implications for player evaluation, recruitment strategies, and in-game decision-making, offering a more objective framework for understanding performance under pressure. Using regular season and postseason data from Baseball Reference, we analyze three key metrics:\n\nOn-Base Plus Slugging (OPS)\n\nTotal Bases (TB)\n\nChampionship Win Probability Added (cWPA)\n\nWe apply hypothesis testing, clustering, and logistic modeling to uncover patterns in high-leverage performance."
